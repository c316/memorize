A name inside a story,
Remembered now forever

All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.

That sits upon the pillow-hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,

To be shattered by the blast,
And to hear the rattling trumpet
Thunder, “Cut away the mast!”
So we shuddered there in silence-
For the stoutest held his breath,
While the hungry sea was roaring
And the breakers talked with Death.
As thus we sat in darkness,
Each one busy with his prayers,
“We are lost!”  the captain shouted
As he staggered down the stairs.
But his little daughter whispered,
As she took his icy hand,
Isn’t God upon the ocean,
Just the same as on the land?”
Then we kissed the little maiden,
And we spoke in better cheer,
And we anchored safe in harbor
When the morn was shining clear.`

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near          
Between the woods and frozen lake        
The darkest evening of the year.             
                                                              
He gives his harness bells a shake           
To ask if there is some mistake,              
The only other sound’s the sweep          
Of easy wind and downy flake.                
 
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep.`

Around the fire my parents sit;               
They sit at home and talk and sing,        
And do not play at anything.                  
Now, with my little gun, I crawl               
All in the dark along the wall,         
And follow round the forest track            
Away behind the sofa back.                    
There, in the night, where none can spy,
All in my hunter’s camp I lie,                   
And play at books that I have read         
Till it is time to go to bed.
These are the hills, these are the woods,
These are my starry solitudes:
And there the river by whose brink
The roaring lions come to drink.
I see the others far away
As if in firelit camp they lay,
And I, like to an Indian scout,
Around their party prowled about.
So, when my nurse comes in for me,
Home I return across the sea,
And go to bed with backward looks
At my dear Land of Story Books. `

Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
Dark behind it rose the forest,
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
Rose the firs with cones upon them;
Bright before it beat the water,
Beat the clear and sunny water,
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.
 
There the wrinkled old Nokomis
Nursed the little Hiawatha,
Rocked him in his linden cradle,
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,
Safely bound with reindeer sinews;
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,
“Hush!  The Naked Bear will hear thee!”
Lulled him into slumber, singing,
“Ewa-yea! My little owlet!”
Who is this, that lights the wigwam?
With his great eyes lights the wigwam?
 
Many things Nokomis taught him
Of the stars that shine in heaven;
Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,
Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;
Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,
Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,
Flaring far away to northward
In the frosty nights of winter;
Showed the broad, white road in heaven,
Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,
Running straight across the heavens,
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.`

Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
“O lovely Pussy!  O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!”
 
Pussy said to the Owl, “You elegant fowl!
How charmingly sweet you sing!
O let us be married!  too long we have tarried:
But what shall we do for a ring?”
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the Bong-tree grows
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.
 
“Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?”  Said the Piggy, “I will.”
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon,
They danced by the light of the moon.`

And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India-rubber ball,
And he sometimes goes so little that there's none of him at all.

He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
He stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.`

  Appeared to know as sure as fate
There was going to be a terrible spat.

  What was told to me by the Chinese plate!)
  
The gingham dog went "bow-wow-wow!"
And the calico cat replied "mee-ow!"
The air was littered, an hour or so,
With bits of gingham and calico,
  While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place
  Up with its hands before its face,
For it always dreaded a family row!
  (Now mind: I 'm only telling you
  What the old Dutch clock declares is true!)
  
The Chinese plate looked very blue,
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!"
But the gingham dog and the calico cat
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,
  Employing every tooth and claw
  In the awfullest way you ever saw—
And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!
  (Don't fancy I exaggerate—
  I got my news from the Chinese plate!)
  
Next morning where the two had sat
They found no trace of dog or cat;
And some folks think unto this day
That burglars stole that pair away!
  But the truth about the cat and pup
  Is this: they ate each other up!
Now what do you really think of that!
  (The old Dutch clock it told me so,
  And that is how I came to know.)`

2(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
 
3And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
 
4And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
 
5To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
 
6And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
 
7And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
 
8And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
 
9And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
 
10And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
 
11For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
 
12And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
 
13And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
 
14”Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”`

To fulfill the Master’s purpose

We realize we are in this world, but not of it
We are Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve
We have been bought with a price, and we choose to glorify the Master
 
We worship the Most High
We serve but One
 
The war rages in Narnia
We put on our armor
We don the helmet of salvation
We take up the shield of faith
We put on the breastplate of righteousness and the belt of truth
We take up the sword of the Spirit
 
We follow the Commander
We worship the Most High
We serve but One
 
We are called to be the salt of the earth
The light in the darkness
Whatever is true
Whatever is noble
Whatever is right
Whatever is pure
Whatever is lovely
Whatever is of good repute
If there is any excellence or anything worthy of praise
We let our mind dwell on these things
 
We are in this world, but not of it
We cling to the ideals of Cair Paravel
We are called by the Name – the Name above every other name
 
We are summoned by the Most High to do His bidding
To be about His business
We follow the Commander
We worship the Master
We serve but One
 
 
 
We will fight the good fight of faith
We will run the race
We will win the prize
We will not be discouraged, we will not be dismayed
We refuse to be distracted from our goal
We will not perish for lack of a vision
We are more than conquerors
We are victors
 
The last time we saw the Master, it was here at the Stone Table
Where He paid the price, the awful price - for us, for us
He has been away for a long time
But there is talk in Narnia of His soon return
 
We have been faithful in the little things
We have trained ourselves today for what we become tomorrow
We have been about the Master’s business
Calling all to come – to come
 
Arise from your slumber
Awake from your sleep
Listen closely and you can hear the hoof beats of the stallion
Behold! The Master is coming on the milk white stallion
 
Holy is His Name
Worthy of our praise
 
Hurry, there is much to be done
Be about the Master’s business
Follow the Commander
Worship the Most High
Serve but One
 
So that in the end He will say,” Well Done”
 
We are the Ladies of Cair Paravel
We are the Knights of Narnia

I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
 
2 If I have the gift of prophecy
and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
and if I have a faith that can move mountains,
but have not love, I am nothing.
 
3 If I give all I possess to the poor
and surrender my body to the flames,
but have not love, I gain nothing.
 
4 Love is patient, love is kind.
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
 
5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking,
it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
 
6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
 
7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
 
8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease;
where there are tongues, they will be stilled;
where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
 
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
 
10 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
 
11 When I was a child,
 I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
 
12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror;
then we shall see face to face.
Now I know in part; then I shall know fully,
even as I am fully known.
 
13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.
But the greatest of these is love.`

If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:.
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:

Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,
And Edith with golden hair.
 
A whisper, and then a silence:
Yet I know by their merry eyes
They are plotting and planning together
To take me by surprise.
 
A sudden rush from the stairway,
A sudden raid from the hall!
By three doors left unguarded
They enter my castle wall!
 
They climb up into my turret
O’er the arms and back of my chair;
If I try escape, they surround me;
They seem to be everywhere.
 
They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me entwine,
Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!
 
Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,
Such an old mustache as I am
Is not a match for you all?
 
I have you fast in my fortress,
And will not let you depart,
But put you down into the dungeon
In the round-tower of my heart.

One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country folk to be up and to arm."
 
Then he said "Good-night!" and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war;
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon like a prison bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
 
Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street
Wanders and watches, with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers,
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
 
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,
By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,--
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town
And the moonlight flowing over all.
 
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
In their night encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,--
A line of black that bends and floats
On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.
 
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse's side,
Now he gazed at the landscape far and near,
Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry tower of the Old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns.
 
A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.`

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.`

    "poem": `As read by Dr. Carver during a commencement address at Selma University in 1942
Figure it out for yourself, my lad,
You’ve all that the greatest of men have had,
Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes
And a brain to use if you would be wise.
With this equipment they all began,
So start for the top and say, “I can.”
 
Look them over, the wise and great,
They take their food from a common plate,
And similar knives and forks they use,
With similar laces they tie their shoes.
The world considers them brave and smart,
But you’ve all they had when they made their start.
 
You can triumph and come to skill,
You can be great if you only will,
You’re well equipped for what fight you choose,
You have legs and arms and a brain to use,
And the man who has risen great deeds to do,
Began his life with no more than you.
 
You are the handicap you must face,
You are the one who must choose your place,
You must say where you want to go,
How much you will study the truth to know.
God has equipped you for life, but He
Lets you decide what you want to be.
 
Courage must come from the soul within,
The man must furnish the will to win.
So figure it out for yourself, my lad.
You were born with all that the great have had,
With your equipment they all began,
Get hold of yourself and say, “I can.”`

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretch'd in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
  In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.`

One thing I have desired of the Lord,
That will I seek;
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
To behold the beauty of the Lord,
And to inquire in His temple.
For in the time of trouble
He shall hide me in His Pavilion;
In the secret place of His tabernacle, He shall hide me;
He shall set me high upon rock.

The village smithy stands;                    
The smith, a mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands;
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands.
 
His hair is crisp, and black, and long,
His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat,
He earns whate’er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.
 
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is low.
 
And children coming home from school
Look in at the open door;
They love to see the flaming forge,
And hear the bellows roar,
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Like chaff from a threshing-floor.

He goes on Sunday to the church,
And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
He hears his daughter’s voice,
Singing in the village choir,
And it makes his heart rejoice.
 
It sounds to him like her mother’s voice,
Singing in Paradise!
He needs must think of her once more,
How in the grave she lies;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
A tear out of his eyes.
 
Toiling – rejoicing – sorrowing,
Onward through life he goes;
Each morning sees some task begun,
Each evening sees it close;
Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night’s repose.
 
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,     
For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus at the flaming forge of life
Our fortunes must be wrought;
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
Each burning deed and thought!`

And silence sounds no worse than cheers 
After earth has stopped the ears. 
 
Now you will not swell the rout 
Of lads that wore their honours out, 
Runners whom renown outran 
And the name died before the man.

The fleet foot on the sill of shade, 
And hold to the low lintel up

A thousand bright lamps shone
  O’er that high festival.
A thousand cups of gold,
  In Judah deem’d divine—
Jehovah’s vessels hold
  The godless Heathen’s wine!
 
In that same hour and hall,
  The fingers of a hand
Came forth against the wall,
  And wrote as if on sand:
The fingers of a man;—
  A solitary hand
Along the letters ran,
  And traced them like a wand.
 
The monarch saw, and shook,
  And bade no more rejoice;
All bloodless wax’d his look,
  And tremulous his voice.
“Let the men of lore appear,
  The wisest of the earth
And expound the words of fear
  Which mar our royal mirth.”
 
Chaldea’s seers are good,
  But here they have no skill;
And the unknown letters stood
  Untold and awful still.
And Babel’s men of age
  Are wise and deep in lore;
But now they were not sage,
  They saw—but knew no more.
 
A captive in the land,
  A stranger and a youth,
He heard the king’s command,
  He saw that writing’s truth.
The lamps around were bright,
  The prophecy in view;
He read it on that night,—
  The morrow proved it true.
 
“Belshazzar’s grave is made,
  His kingdom pass’d away,
He, in the balance weigh’d,
  Is light and worthless clay.

  His canopy the stone;
The Mede is at his gate!
  The Persian on his throne!”`

I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
I feel ye now- I feel ye in your strength-
O spells more sure than e'er Judaean king
Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

But stay! these walls- these ivy-clad arcades-
These moldering plinths- these sad and blackened shafts-
These vague entablatures- this crumbling frieze-
These shattered cornices- this wreck- this ruin-
These stones- alas! these grey stones- are they all-
All of the famed, and the colossal left
By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

'Not all'- the Echoes answer me- 'not all!
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
We rule the hearts of mightiest men- we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds.
We are not impotent- we pallid stones.
Not all our power is gone- not all our fame-
Not all the magic of our high renown-
Not all the wonder that encircles us-
Not all the mysteries that in us lie-
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment,
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.' `

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, 
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken, 
And stoop and build 'em up with worn out tools; 
  
If you can make one heap of all your winnings   
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, 
And lose, and start again at your beginnings 
And never breath a word about your loss; 
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew 
To serve your turn long after they are gone, 
And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!";
 
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch; 
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; 
If all men count with you, but none too much; 
If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run - 
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, 
And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!`

Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.`

A rainbow in the sky.

So be it when I grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.`

    "poem": `'Tis a lesson you should heed,
Try, try again;
If at first you don't succeed,
Try, try again;
Then your courage should appear,
For, if you will persevere,
You will conquer, never fear;
Try, try again.

Once or twice though you should fail,
Try, try again;
If you would at last prevail,
Try, try again;
If we strive, 'tis no disgrace
Though we do not win the race;
What should you do in the case?
Try, try again.

Time will bring you your reward,
Try, try again.
All that other folks can do,
Why, with patience, should not you?
Only keep this rule in view;
Try, try again.`

    "poem": `I sit beside the fire and think 
of all that I have seen, 
of meadow-flowers and butterflies 
in summers that have been; 

Of yellow leaves and gossamer 
in autumns that there were, 
with morning mist and silver sun 
and wind upon my hair. 

I sit beside the fire and think 
of how the world will be 
when winter comes without a spring 
that I shall never see. 

For still there are so many things 
that I have never seen: 
in every wood in every spring 
there is a different green. 

I sit beside the fire and think 
of people long ago, 
and people who will see a world 
that I shall never know. 
But all the while I sit and think 
of times there were before, 
I listen for returning feet 
and voices at the door.`

    "title": "Once To Every Man and Nation",
    "poem": `Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, some great decision, offering each the bloom or blight,
And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light.

Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis prosperous to be just;
Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside,
Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.

By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,
Toiling up new Calv’ries ever with the cross that turns not back;
New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,
They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.

Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong;
Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong;
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown,
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.`
